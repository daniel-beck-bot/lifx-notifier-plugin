<div>
  This plugin will use <a href="http://lifx.co">LIFX</a> smart lightbulbs as a build indicator.
  It automatically discovers any lightbulbs on the network - and changes them to blue/green based on build status.
  <p/>When building - it will show a pale white light.
  <p/>There is no configuration currently - it will show the status of the most recent build.
